# LBKT-Reading-Proficiency

The LBKT model tracks learners' knowledge states by capturing their multiple learning behaviors' complex effects on the learning and forgetting process. The model summarizes three typical behaviors as **Speed**, **Attempts**, **Hints** and investigates their effects.

The Differentiated Behavior Effect Quantifying module (shown in Figure (b)) and  Fused Behavior Effect Measuring module (shown in Figure (c)) capture the distinctive and fused effect of behaviors on learners' knowledge acquisition respectively. And a forget gate is designed to combine the forgetting factor with the behavior affected knowledge acquisition to update learners' knowledge state.
