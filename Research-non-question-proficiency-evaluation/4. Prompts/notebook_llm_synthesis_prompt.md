<div style="font-size:2.5em; font-weight:bold; text-align:center; margin-top:20px;">Multi-Source Research Synthesis Prompt</div>

## 1. Task Overview

Analyze and synthesize three research reports on the Non-Question Proficiency Evaluation Framework (NEXS-399) from ChatGPT, Gemini, and Opus. Extract key findings, methodologies, and recommendations from each source, identify agreements and disagreements, and create a unified synthesis highlighting insights from combining all three perspectives.

## 2. Research Context

The project develops a framework for estimating student proficiency gains from non-assessment learning activities: video content, PDF/text reading, and interactive materials. Key questions: how engagement data (time, completion rates, interactions) infers proficiency gains, what methodologies exist for non-question assessment, which metrics are most predictive, and how content types affect estimation.

## 3. Source Documents

Three reports: `ChatGPT_ Deep-Research.md` (literature review, heuristic approaches, behavioral analytics, engagement correlation, Bayesian/IRT, stealth assessment), `Gemini_Deep-Research.md` (technical architectures, cognitive strategies, agentic systems, validation protocols), `Opus_Deep-Research.md` (structured frameworks, tiered recommendations, BKT extensions, HLR models, engagement-weighted mastery, content-specific considerations).

## 4. Analysis Process

Analyze each document individually, extracting: core methodologies with priority levels, key findings with evidence, engagement metrics by category, content-specific recommendations, implementation guidance, and challenges. Then synthesize across sources by identifying convergence points (agreement), divergence points (conflicts), and complementary insights (unique contributions). Create a unified framework integrating methodologies, combining metrics into a taxonomy, and developing an implementation roadmap.

## 5. Output Structure

Provide an executive summary with methodology counts and consensus findings. Organize methodologies into three tiers: Tier 1 (2+ sources, strong evidence), Tier 2 (1-2 sources, good evidence), Tier 3 (single source, potential). For each methodology, include description, source attribution, evidence strength, complexity, and use cases.

Create an engagement metrics taxonomy (time-based, completion, interaction, behavioral, quality indicators) with predictive strength, source attribution, content types, and implementation considerations. Develop content-specific sections for video, text/PDF, and interactive content with unified recommendations, optimal parameters, engagement patterns, and estimation approaches.

Provide a five-phase implementation roadmap: foundation (data collection, infrastructure), baseline models (heuristics, weighted approaches), validation/calibration, advanced models (ML, adaptive systems), optimization/personalization. For each phase, include required components, dependencies, outcomes, and validation criteria.

Include sections on challenges/limitations, key insights (top 5-10 from combining sources), and a source comparison matrix showing methodology and metric coverage.

## 6. Quality Guidelines

Base all claims on source documents only. Cover all major topics from all three sources. Create a true synthesis identifying patterns visible only when sources are combined, not just summaries. Maintain clarity and logical organization. Always attribute findings to specific sources. When sources disagree, present both perspectives with reasoning.

## 7. Special Instructions

Explain technical terms using document context. Preserve formulas and models with implementation detail. Maintain citations and examples. Use academic, professional tone. Focus on actionable insights for implementation.

## 8. Expected Output

Create a comprehensive synthesis detailed enough for implementation planning, well-organized for reference, and complete in covering all major aspects from all three sources. Aim for 3000-5000 words, prioritizing quality and completeness over length.

---

**Read all three source documents thoroughly, understand each perspective and key contributions, then synthesize following the structure above to create a unified document bringing together the best insights from all three reports.**
